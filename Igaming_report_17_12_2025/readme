DATA ANALYSIS

1. Data Cleaning
•	When the first two numbers of Created Date/Time are ≤12, the day and month appear switched.
•	If the Processed Date/Time completes on the next day, the FTD date is recorded as the next day.

2. Deposit Frequency Distribution
•	The bar chart shows the count of clients by number of deposits.
•	Most clients make 1 deposit, with the number of clients decreasing as the number of deposits increases.
•	Bonus usage decreases as the number of deposits increases:
o	1 deposit → 57.96% bonus
o	2 deposits → 43.68% bonus
o	3 deposits → 39.73% bonus
o	4 deposits → 39.26% bonus
o	5+ deposits → 36.84% bonus

3. Cohort Analysis
•	Cohort analysis shows retention over months 0–5.
•	Retention is highest in the first month (period 0) and gradually declines over subsequent periods.
•	Monthly retention patterns vary by cohort; February and April cohorts have the largest initial deposit percentages.

4. Deposit Amount Over Time
•	The bar chart shows sum of deposits by date.
•	Deposits are relatively stable across the months, with occasional spikes, including a notable peak in April.
•	Bonus-related deposits are smaller on average, with occasional outliers.

5. Brand Distribution
•	Brand distribution is nearly balanced between the brands.
•	No major skew is observed, suggesting consistent client behaviour across brands.

6. Bonus-Related Deposits
•	In the first quarter, bonus deposits spike on Fridays, possibly due to promotions or campaigns.
•	Bonus deposits are more frequent during weekends (including Fridays) in the second quarter.

7. Dashboard Interaction
•	A reset button is available in the top-right corner to clear all filters and return to the default view.


PROPOSAL

Proposal 1 — Increase Second Deposit Conversion (Main Recommendation)
Data shows a sharp drop after the first deposit and a large decline in bonus usage from deposit 1 → 2.
Because the second deposit is the strongest indicator of long-term engagement, focusing here gives the highest return.
Suggested actions:
•	Targeted “Second Deposit Booster”: personalized bonus or cashback that activates only after the first deposit is completed.
•	Timed offer: send within 24–48 hours after FTD (based on the observed next-day processing pattern).
•	Weekend reinforcement: since bonuses are already more common on weekends, introduce a weekend-specific second deposit perk.
•	A/B testing: vary incentive size for users with small FTDs (since bonus users tend to deposit less).
•	Expected impact: higher conversion to deposit #2 → improved retention in months 1–2 → higher lifetime value.


Proposal 2 — Optimize Bonus Allocation for Profitability
You observed that bonus-related deposits are smaller, weekend-heavy, and show promo-driven spikes.
This means bonuses may not be economically efficient in their current form.
Suggested actions:
•	Reduce blanket weekend bonuses and replace them with tiered bonuses that reward higher activity.
•	Shift budget toward first-to-second-deposit incentives, where ROI is higher.
•	Introduce “smart bonuses” that scale with user behavior (deposit size, frequency, time of day).
•	Cap low-value bonus chasers with soft rules (e.g., minimum wagering or minimum deposit).
